# Slidey-Slimes
Readme TBD  
  
- Wemos D1 mini v4.0, TP4056, BMI160 or BMI270, SS22F32 switch, 804040 battery or smaller, optional XH2.54 connectors.  
- Easy to assemble! Just slide the components into the tray, solder everything together, and slide the assembled tray into the case.  
- Fairly compact, only slightly bigger than SlimeX, while accepting 5cm wide straps.  
- No need for any screws or glue, everything slides in, and the case closes with a satisfying snap.  
- You will need to have your flow rate and PA dialed in very well, as the tolerances are rather tight.  
  
  
  
Added auxiliary tracker cases! The bottom should be printed from TPU. Otherwise, if you don't have TPU, I'd suggest using a different design, as this will be quite bulky and uncomfortable. Works with up to 4cm straps.

Enjoy!  
  
- The f3d file is an absolute mess, don't judge me, it's my first cad project lol.
