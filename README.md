# Slidey-Slimes
Readme TBD  
  
- Wemos D1 mini v4.0, TP4056, BMI160 or BMI270, SS22F32 switch, 804040 battery or smaller, optional XH2.54 connectors.  
- Easy to assemble! Just slide the components into the tray, solder everything together, and slide the assembled tray into the case.  
- Fairly compact, only slightly bigger than SlimeX, while accepting 5cm wide straps.  
- No need for any screws or glue, everything slides in, and the case closes with a satisfying snap.  
- You will need to have your flow rate and PA dialed in very well, as the tolerances are rather tight.  
  
Enjoy!  
  
- The f3d file is an absolute mess, don't judge me, it's my first cad project lol.
